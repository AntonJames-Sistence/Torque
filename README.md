## Technologies

* The Canvas API is utilized to render the game and dynamically update its parameters, delivering a visually engaging and interactive experience. By leveraging the power of the Canvas API, the game graphics are efficiently rendered on the screen, allowing animations and responsive gameplay. Additionally, the API enables game parameters such as player scores, health, and other crucial gameplay elements, ensuring that the game remains engaging and challenging throughout the gaming session.
* Webpack is employed to bundle and transpile the source JavaScript code, optimizing the development workflow and enhancing the compatibility and performance of the web application. By leveraging Webpack's capabilities, the source code is efficiently bundled into a single file, reducing network requests and improving load times. Moreover, Webpack's transpilation feature ensures that the JavaScript code is transformed to a compatible version, enabling cross-browser support and taking advantage of the latest language features.
* npm (Node Package Manager) to manage project dependencies.

## Future Implementations:

* Enhanced car sprites.
* Car Animations: Implement dynamic animations for the cars, such as smooth acceleration, braking, and turning movements, to create a more immersive and engaging gameplay experience.
* Expanded Collectible Items: Introduce a wider variety of items for players to collect during the game, providing additional challenges, rewards, and power-ups to enhance gameplay dynamics.
* Pause Functionality: Implement a pause feature that allows players to temporarily halt the game, providing flexibility and convenience without losing progress. This feature will enable players to take breaks or attend to other tasks while retaining their current game state.
